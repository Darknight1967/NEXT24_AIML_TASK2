This project focuses on developing an innovative solution for farmers to easily diagnose plant diseases through image analysis. It begins with the collection of a comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, sourced from platforms such as the Kaggle dataset PlantVillage Dataset. The dataset is crucial for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying various plant diseases. The CNN model is meticulously trained to differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by specific diseases, leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in predictions.

Once trained, the model is integrated into a user-friendly web interface designed for farmers, where they can simply upload images of their crop leaves. Upon upload, the system instantly analyzes the image, diagnoses any potential diseases, and provides management recommendations tailored to the identified condition. This immediate feedback loop is invaluable for farmers, enabling them to take timely and informed action to protect their crops, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing the impact of plant diseases. The web interface is designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, ensuring that even those with minimal technical expertise can effectively utilize the tool.
